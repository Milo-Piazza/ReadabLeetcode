Here I document some of my Leetcode solutions. I wanted to start this collection because I noticed a discrepancy between the most prolific users in the average problem's solutions section and the average Leetcode user. The most prolific Leetcoders are much more similar to competitive coders than average: they principally optimize for speed. Nothing wrong with that in and of itself, of course, but this often comes at the expense of readability. Most users, on the other hand, are career software engineers using it to prepare for interviews, and interviewers care much more about readability as long as you have a decent asymptotic runtime. When I do Leetcode, I aim to optimize for readability, maintainability, and explainability -- in other words, the kind of things most interviewers are looking for. Hopefully these examples are helpful, especially if you're an average engineer like me!

I almost always use Python because it's an ideal interviewing language -- it's flexible, powerful, has lots of useful libraries and needs very little boilerplate. Not having to worry about Python's speed in an interview context is also a plus!
